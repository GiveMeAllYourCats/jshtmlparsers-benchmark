# jshtmlparsers-benchmark

#### Usage:

`git clone git@github.com:GiveMeAllYourCats/jshtmlparsers-benchmark.git && cd jshtmlparsers-benchmark && npm i && node benchmark`

#### What is a operation?

A operation (or cycle) consists of 258 html files being read one by one, they can be small, they can be big, have large CSS or large SCRIPT tags. These are real life html files derived from the repository of [htmlparser-benchmark](https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/htmlparser-benchmark) have a look at [these files that are tested per cycle](https://github.com/GiveMeAllYourCats/jshtmlparsers-benchmark/tree/master/html)

#### How are results generated?

Each parser is spawned in a web worker and then it tries to create as much cycles as possible. The end results is the variable `x amount of html files parses per/sec`

#### Results:
